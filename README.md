## Technologies used
---
- ### Languages:
    - **React**, Chosen for its exceptional capability in building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for efficient development and easy maintenance, making it ideal for creating an engaging and interactive front-end experience.
    - **HTML**, The backbone of our app's structure. HTML provides the essential framework, enabling us to define the content and layout with clarity and precision. Its simplicity and effectiveness are the reasons we relied on it for structuring our web content.
    - **CSS**, Selected for its powerful styling capabilities. CSS allows us to create a visually appealing and consistent design across our application. Its flexibility and control over the presentation layer bring our user interface to life with elegant and responsive design elements.
    - **Django**, The heart of our back-end development. We chose Django for its robustness, scalability, and security features. Its ability to handle complex data and deliver high-performance web applications makes it a perfect fit for our backend needs. Djangoâ€™s extensive libraries and ORM for database interactions streamline our development process, ensuring a solid and efficient back-end architecture.
    
- ### Frameworks and Libraries:
    - **Django REST**, We chose the Django REST Framework for its powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. It's particularly effective in handling serialization and providing a clean, browsable API, which is crucial for efficiently developing and maintaining the data layer of our application. Its compatibility with Django makes it a natural choice for extending our backend capabilities.
    - **Vite**, Vite was selected for its incredibly fast build tool that significantly enhances the development experience. By leveraging native ES modules, Vite provides lightning-fast server start and hot module replacement (HMR), which boosts our productivity and shortens the feedback loop during development. Its simplicity and performance optimizations are key for a smooth and efficient frontend build process.
    - **Material UI**, Material UI was implemented in the SignIn component, but because of my love for bootstrap and its more intuitive for me I chose to make the rest of the UI with bootstrap. Inspired by Google's Material Design, it offers a comprehensive suite of pre-designed components and customization options.
    - **Bootstrap 5**, Bootstrap 5 is an excellent framework for crafting responsive and mobile-first layouts. We incorporated it for its vast array of ready-to-use components and its grid system, which simplifies the design process. The flexibility and ease of customization provided by Bootstrap 5 enable us to rapidly develop adaptive layouts that look great on all devices.

- ### Databases:
    - **PostgreSQL on ElephantSQL**, We selected PostgreSQL, hosted on ElephantSQL, for our database needs, owing to PostgreSQL's reputation as a robust, open-source relational database system. Known for its reliability, data integrity, and scalability, PostgreSQL offers a versatile and powerful foundation for handling complex queries and large datasets. ElephantSQL, as our chosen hosting service, enhances this experience by providing a fully-managed PostgreSQL hosting that is reliable and easy to set up. This combination ensures our database is not only performant but also secure and accessible, with ElephantSQL handling the intricacies of database management. This setup allows us to focus on development without worrying about database administration, making our workflow more efficient and effective. The choice of PostgreSQL on ElephantSQL aligns perfectly with our need for a powerful database solution that is both manageable and scalable.

- ### Tools:
    - **dj-rest-auth**, Streamlines creation of RESTful authentication endpoints in Django.
    - **django-cors-headers**, Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for secure API interactions.
    - **Gunicorn**, A robust WSGI server for deploying Django applications.
    - **psycopg2**, Connects Django to PostgreSQL, offering powerful database functionalities.
    - **PyJWT**, Handles JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
    - **Whitenoise**, Simplifies static file management in Django applications.
    - **Git and GitHub**, Version control system used for source code management.
    - **Heroku**, Cloud hosting service for deploying applications.
    - **VS Code**, IDE used for development.

## Information Architecture

### Database

Our application utilizes a robust and well-structured database to efficiently manage and store data. The database is designed to support the functionality of our application seamlessly. Below is an overview of the database models and their relationships:

#### User Model
- **Fields:**
  - `email`: EmailField - A unique email address for each user.
  - `is_active`: BooleanField - Indicates whether the user's account is active.
  - `is_admin`: BooleanField - Determines if the user has administrative privileges.
- **Description:** Custom user model replacing Django's default User model. It is used for authenticating and managing users in the application.

#### ShoppingList Model
- **Fields:**
  - `name`: CharField - The name of the shopping list.
  - `items`: JSONField - A list of items, with each item comprising an item name and quantity.
  - `user`: ForeignKey - Links to the User model, indicating ownership of the shopping list.
- **Description:** Represents individual shopping lists. Each list is associated with a user and can contain multiple items.

#### ToDoList Model
- **Fields:**
  - `description`: TextField - A description of the to-do item.
  - `done`: BooleanField - Indicates whether the to-do item has been completed.
  - `due_date`: DateField - The due date for the to-do item.
  - `user`: ForeignKey - Links to the User model, indicating ownership of the to-do item.
- **Description:** Captures individual to-do items. Each item has a description, completion status, due date, and is linked to a user.

#### Relationships
- Both `ShoppingList` and `ToDoList` models are related to the `User` model via a ForeignKey. This relationship establishes ownership of the lists and tasks by a user.

This database structure is optimized for performance and scalability, ensuring that data retrieval and storage are efficient and reliable. Our design choices reflect a commitment to providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
